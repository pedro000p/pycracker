# pycracker
One simple program to crack the users password with dictionary file.
This a academic construction of a program to crack passwords in Linux environments. 
It was made by me, Pedro Pereira and my dear colleage Pedro Louren√ßo.

We had chose the module argparse and not docopt.

The output phrases are in Portuguese but the core is in English. Later I will do this update to be totally in English.

We made this with Python3
The syntax of the program(argparse) is:

./pycracker.py [-h] -d <dicionario> [-p <passwords>] [-u <user>] [-v --verbose] [--version]

So, you have to create a dictionary file with possible passwords. If you put the right password the program will match.
